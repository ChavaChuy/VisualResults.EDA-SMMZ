# VisualResults.EDA-SMMZ

The folder of Real_Results are the visual results the all properties used in this project: Organic Matter (OM), Phosphurus (P), potential Hydrogen (pH) and Sum of Bases (SB). Every property was evaluated for differents homogeneity levels (0.1,0.2,...,0.9,1.0). The images names you will find like: property_homogeneitylevel. For example: OM_01.pdf.


The folder of Artificial_Results are the visual results the property that was simuleted in this project. We simulated 10 differents instances for every size WxH. WxH means the number of soil samples in the width and height of the agricultural field, respectively. The differents sizes are 6x7, 10x10, 15x10, 15x14 and 20x20. Every instance was evaluated for three differents homgeneity levels 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9. The images names you will find like: (1,2,3...,10). Every number means the instance solved.
